The 2mal3's Recips datapack adds, changes fixes and upgrades over 400 different, well considered recipes to improve the overall game experience while still keeping the vanilla feel. Unlike other datapacks, it doesn't add overpowered or unbalanced recipes for like Totems or Elytras that ruin the game balance, but only makes suptile changes that do not disrupt on the gameplay. On top of that, all recipes are deeply integrated into the recipe book with groups and advancements, so that you do not have to remember any recipes and automatically learn about them when you have the required resources.
